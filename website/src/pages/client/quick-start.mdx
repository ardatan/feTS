# Quick start

feTS Client is a fully type safe HTTP Client that uses [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/)
specification. It automatically infers types from the document and gives you a type safe API to
interact with your API.

## Installation

<LegacyPackageCmd packages={['fets']} />

## Usage

First, you need to create a TypeScript file that exports your OpenAPI document. Due to the
limitations in TypeScript, we cannot import types from JSON files directly.
[See this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/32063). Just copy and paste the
content of the OpenAPI file inside the TypeScript file, and export it with `as const` modifier.

```ts filename="openapi.ts"
export default { openapi: '3.0.0' /* ... */ } as const
```

Then, you can create a client instance by passing the OpenAPI document to the `createClient`
function.

```ts filename="client.ts"
import { createClient, Mutable } from 'fets'
import openapi from './openapi'

const client = createClient<Mutable<typeof openapi>>({})

const response = await client['/pets'].get()

const pets = await response.json()
console.log(pets)
```

### Infer types from feTS Server

If you are using [feTS Server](/server/quick-start) and share the types of your router instance. You
can infer types from there directly.

```ts filename="client.ts"
import { createClient } from 'fets'
// Don't forget to add `type` to get the types only.
import type { router } from './router'

const client = createClient<typeof router>({
  endpoint: 'http://localhost:3000'
})

const response = await client['/pets'].get()
const pets = await response.json()
console.log(pets)
```
