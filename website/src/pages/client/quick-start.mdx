# Quickstart Guide

Welcome to the feTS Client, a fully type-safe HTTP Client that leverages the
[OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification. It automatically infers types from the
document, providing you with a type-safe interface for seamless API interaction.

## Installation

To install the feTS Client, use the following command:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i fets
```

## Usage with Existing REST API

<Callout type="info">
  Before diving in, make sure that you have an OpenAPI document, which is a language-agnostic
  specification for HTTP APIs. You can usually retrieve it from your server, or manually create it
  if you're familiar with the OpenAPI schema. Check out the [OpenAPI
  docs](https://swagger.io/specification/) to learn more.
</Callout>

Start by creating a TypeScript file that exports your OpenAPI document. Due to certain limitations
in TypeScript, importing types directly from JSON files isn't currently supported
([see this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/32063)). To work around this,
simply copy and paste the content of your OpenAPI file into the TypeScript file and then export it
with the `as const` modifier.

```ts filename="openapi.ts"
export default { openapi: '3.0.0' /* ... */ } as const
```

Next, create a client instance by passing the OpenAPI document to the `createClient` function.

```ts
import { createClient, type NormalizeOAS } from 'fets'
import type openapi from './openapi'

const client = createClient<NormalizeOAS<typeof openapi>>({})

const response = await client['/pets'].get()

const pets = await response.json()
console.log(pets)
```

<Callout type="warning">
  If you get `This node exceeds the maximum length error from TypeScript`, you need to add
  `disableSizeLimit: true` to `compilerOptions` in your `tsconfig.json` file.
</Callout>

## Usage with feTS Server

If you're using feTS Server, and you're sharing the types of your router instance, you can infer
types directly from there.

```ts
import { createClient } from 'fets'
// Remember to add `type` to import types only.
import type { router } from './router'

const client = createClient<typeof router>({
  endpoint: 'http://localhost:3000'
})

const response = await client['/pets'].get()
const pets = await response.json()
console.log(pets)
```

This quick start guide should provide you with a solid foundation for using feTS Client. Enjoy
exploring its full potential!
