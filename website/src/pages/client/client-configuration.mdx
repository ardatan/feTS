# Client Configuration

feTS Client allows you to customize its behavious by enabling various plugins. However, there's also
an additional configuration that can be passed to the `createClient` function.

## Customizing The `fetch` Function

By default, feTS Client uses the `fetch` function provided by the environment. However, you can also
pass a custom `fetch` function to the `createClient` function.

One possible use case is enabling HTTP/2 support. While HTTP/2 is automatically handled by most
environments, Node.js requires additional configuration to enable it.

To enable HTTP/2 in Node.js, you can use the `fetch-h2` package:

```ts
import fetchH2 from 'fetch-h2'
import { oas } from './oas'

const client = createClient<typeof oas>({
  fetch: fetchH2 as typeof fetch
})
```

## Global Parameters

You can also pass global parameters to the `createClient` function. These parameters will be passed
to every request made by the client.

```ts
import { oas } from './oas'

const client = createClient<typeof oas>({
  globalParams: {
    headers: {
      Authorization: 'Bearer 123'
    }
  }
})
```
