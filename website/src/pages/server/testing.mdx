# Testing

feTS has built-in support for HTTP injection. You can use any testing framework of your choice.

You can use the fetch method on your router instance for calling the router instance as if you were
doing an HTTP request.

<Callout>
  Calling the router.fetch method does not send an actual HTTP request. It basically simulates the
  HTTP request which is 100% conform with how Request/Response work.
</Callout>

### Using `fetch` method

You can use `fetch` method from the router instance directly or you can pass it to any client that
accepts a `fetch` function.

`router.fetch` is compliant with
[WHATWG `fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API.

```ts
import { router } from './router'

const response = await router.fetch('/todo', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: 'Buy milk',
    completed: false
  })
})

const responseJson = await response.json()
console.assert(responseJson.title === 'Buy milk', 'Title should be "Buy milk"')
```

### Creating a feTS Client for Testing

You can use [feTS Client](/client/quick-start) to test your API in a type-safe way. It doesn't need
you to start any real HTTP server.

```ts
import { createClient } from 'fets'
import { router } from './router'

const client = createClient<typeof router>({
  fetchFn: router.fetch,
  endpoint: 'http://localhost:3000'
})

// Everything below is fully typed
const response = await client['/todo'].put({
  json: {
    title: 'Buy milk',
    completed: false
  }
})

const responseJson = await response.json()
console.assert(responseJson.title === 'Buy milk', 'Title should be "Buy milk"')
```
