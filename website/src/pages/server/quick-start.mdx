# Quickstart

feTS Server is a library that allows you to create a fully type-safe REST API.

- It includes a high-speed HTTP server.
- The schemas are based on [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) allowing the use of any tool from
  this ecosystem.
- It provides [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) documentation, making the API consumable
  with any OpenAPI compatible tool.
- It is platform-agnostic, and thus can be deployed on any platform that supports JavaScript.
- It offers a simple way to test your API with [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)

<Callout type="info">
  For JavaScript environments, we highly recommend using [feTS Client](/client/quick-start), which
  is a HTTP client that uses OpenAPI to provide end-to-end type-safety without code generation.

## Installation

Use the following command to install feTS Server:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i fets uWebSockets.js@uNetworking/uWebSockets.js#semver:^20
```

## Creating Your First Route

The following example demonstrates how to create a route with feTS that returns a greeting message:

```ts filename="greetings-router.ts"
// The example code assumes that we're in a Node.js environment.
// It's recommended to use `Response` from `fets` as the native one isn't type-safe.
import { createRouter, Response } from 'fets'
import { App } from 'uWebSockets.js'

// Creating a new router
const router = createRouter()
  // Use `.route` method to create a new /greetings route
  .route({
    path: '/greetings',
    method: 'GET',
    // Defining the response schema
    schemas: {
      responses: {
        // The status code
        200: {
          type: 'object',
          properties: {
            message: {
              type: 'string'
            }
          },
          required: ['message'],
          additionalProperties: false
        }
      }
    },
    handler() {
      // If the status code is not specified, it defaults to 200
      return Response.json({
        message: 'Hello from feTS!'
      })
    }
  })

App()
  .any('/*', router)
  .listen(3000, () => {
    console.info(`Server is listening on http://localhost:3000`)
  })
```

Test your API using [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/), available at
`http://localhost:3000/docs`.

## The `.route` API

The `.route()` method allows you to create new routes and it accepts the following arguments:

- `method`: The HTTP method of the request. If not provided, it handles all methods.
- `path`: The URL pattern to match the request. The URL pattern is a string that follows the
  [URLPattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLPattern) standard. Learn more
  about URL patterns
  [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLPattern/URLPattern#matching_a_pathname).
- `schemas`: An object containing the schemas for the request and response, providing type safety
  and validation. Learn more about schemas
  [here](#end-to-end-type-safety-and-validation-with-json-schema).
- `handler`: The function called when the request matches the specified method and path. This
  function can be either synchronous or asynchronous. If asynchronous, it should return a `Promise`
  that resolves to a `Response` object.

The feTS `Router` gives you an extended version of the regular `Request` object. It has the
following properties:

- `request.params`: An object containing the parameters passed in an URL.
- `request.query`: An object containing the query parameters.

You can learn more about the original `Request` object
[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request).
