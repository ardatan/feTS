# Quick Start

FETS Server is a library that allows you create a fully type-safe REST API.

- Comes with a super fast HTTP server
- Schemas are based on [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) so you can use any tool from that
  ecosystem
- Exports [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) documentation so you can consume the API with
  any tool that supports OpenAPI
- Platform agnostic so can be deployed to anywhere that supports JavaScript
- Provides a simple way to test your API with [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)

> If the consumer is a JavaScript environment, we highly recommend using [FETS Client](/client)
> which is fully type-safe HTTP client that uses OpenAPI to generate the client.

## Installation

<PackageCmd packages={['fets']} />

## Write your first route

Let's write a simple route that returns a greeting message.

```ts filename="greetings-router.ts"
// We recommend you to use `Response` from `fets`, because the native one isn't type-safe
// Let's assume that we are using Node.js
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { createRouter, Response } from 'fets'

// Create a router
const router = createRouter()
  // `.route` method should be in chain after `createRouter`
  .route({
    path: '/greetings',
    method: 'GET',
    // Define the response schema
    schemas: {
      responses: {
        // The status code
        200: {
          type: 'object',
          properties: {
            message: {
              type: 'string'
            }
          },
          required: ['message'],
          additionalProperties: false
        }
      }
      // Schemas should always have `as const` modifier
    } as const,
    handler() {
      return Response.json(
        {
          message: 'Hello from FETS!'
        },
        {
          // We recommend to provide the status code explicitly
          status: 200
        }
      )
    }
  })

// Create a Node.js server
const server = createServer(router)
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.info(`Swagger UI is available at http://localhost:3000/docs`)
})
```

<Callout>
  You can play with your API with [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) that is
  available at <code>http://localhost:3000/docs</code>

## `.route` API

It uses `.route()` method to add routes to the router with the following parameters;

- `method`: The HTTP method of the request. This is optional and it handles all methods if it's not
  given.
- `path`: The URL pattern that the request should match. The url pattern is a string that follows
  the [URLPattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLPattern) standard. You can
  learn more about URL patterns
  [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLPattern/URLPattern#matching_a_pathname).
- `schemas`: An object that contains the schemas for the request and response. This brings a
  type-safety and validation to your requests and responses. You can learn more about schemas
  [here](#end-to-end-type-safety-and-validation-with-json-schema).
- `handler`: The function that will be called when the request matches the given method and path.
  This function can be either synchronous or asynchronous. If it's asynchronous, it should return a
  `Promise` that resolves to a `Response` object.

`Router` gives you an extended version of the regular `Request` object that has the following
properties:

- `request.params`: An object that contains the parameters that are given in the url pattern.
- `request.query`: An object that contains the query parameters that are given in the url.

You can learn more about the original `Request` object
[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request).
