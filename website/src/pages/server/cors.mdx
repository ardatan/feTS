# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in feTS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that restricts web browsers from accessing
resources outside their own domain. This becomes relevant when your API and web applications are
deployed on different domains or subdomains.

Consider an example where your web client is deployed to `example.com` and your feTS server resides
at `api.example.com`. Due to security constraints, the browser will prevent XHR requests to a domain
other than the one currently displayed in the browser's address bar.

To handle CORS issues, you have two main strategies:

1. **Proxy your requests:** Setting up a proxy or redirect to forward requests from
   `example.com/api/*` to `api.example.com` will circumvent CORS issues entirely.

2. **Configure feTS to use CORS headers:** feTS provides a CORS plugin that you can configure when
   creating the server. This can be done either by passing a `CORSOptions` object or a builder
   function that returns the `CORSOptions` object.

The `CORSOptions` can be configured as follows:

```ts
export type CORSOptions =
  | {
      origin?: string[] | string
      methods?: string[]
      allowedHeaders?: string[]
      exposedHeaders?: string[]
      credentials?: boolean
      maxAge?: number
    }
  | false
```

Here's an example configuration using `CORSOptions`:

```ts
import { createRouter } from 'fets'

const router = createRouter({
  plugins: [
    useCORS({
      origin: 'http://localhost:4000',
      credentials: true,
      allowedHeaders: ['X-Custom-Header'],
      methods: ['POST']
    })
  ]
})
```

This configuration will return the following headers:

```yaml
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: 'http://localhost:4000'
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Custom-Header
```

Alternatively, you can use a builder function that takes your request and constructs the options:

```ts
import { createRouter } from 'fets'

const router = createRouter({
  plugins: [
    useCORS(request => {
      const requestOrigin = request.headers.get('origin')
      return {
        origin: requestOrigin,
        credentials: true,
        allowedHeaders: ['X-Custom-Header'],
        methods: ['POST']
      }
    })
  ]
})
```

This will return the same headers as the previous example, but will take the `origin` from the
request and return it in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.

## Default CORS Setting with the Plugin

By default, feTS will return `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \*` when preflight requests are made.
This allows cross-origin requests from browsers to work out of the box. However, it may be more
secure to restrict access to a specific domain when deploying to production
