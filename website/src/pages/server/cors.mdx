# CORS

CORS stands for Cross Origin Resource Sharing. In a nutshell, as a security measure, browsers aren't
allowed to access resources outside their own domain.

If your api and web apps are deployed to different domains (or subdomains), you'll have to worry
about CORS. For example, if your web client is deployed to example.com but your FETS Server is
api.example.com. For security reasons your browser will not allow XHR requests (like the kind that
the HTTP client makes) to a domain other than the one currently in the browser's address bar.

To deal with this you have two options:

_1. Avoid CORS by proxying your requests_ e.g. If you setup a proxy or redirect to forward requests
from `example.com/api/*` to `api.example.com`, you avoid CORS issues all together.

_2. Configure FETS to send back CORS headers_ FETS comes with a CORS plugin - CORS can be configured
when creating the server either by passing a CORSOptions object, or a builder function that returns
the CORSOptions object.

```ts
export type CORSOptions =
  | {
      origin?: string[] | string
      methods?: string[]
      allowedHeaders?: string[]
      exposedHeaders?: string[]
      credentials?: boolean
      maxAge?: number
    }
  | false
```

### Example configuration using CORSOptions

```ts
import { createRouter } from 'fets'

const router = createRouter({
  plugins: [
    useCORS({
      origin: 'http://localhost:4000',
      credentials: true,
      allowedHeaders: ['X-Custom-Header'],
      methods: ['POST']
    })
  ]
})
```

This will return the following headers:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: 'http://localhost:4000'
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Custom-Header
```

### Example configuration using builder function

You can also pass a function to the cors property, that takes your request and constructs the
options

```ts
import { createRouter } from 'fets'

const router = createRouter({
  plugins: [
    useCORS(request => {
      const requestOrigin = request.headers.get('origin')
      return {
        origin: requestOrigin,
        credentials: true,
        allowedHeaders: ['X-Custom-Header'],
        methods: ['POST']
      }
    })
  ]
})
```

This will return the same headers as the previous example, but take the `origin` of the request, and
return it in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.

## Default CORS setting with the plugin

By default, FETS will return `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` when preflight requests are made.

This means cross origin requests from browsers work out of the box - however it may be appropriate
to lock to a specific domain before deploying to production.
