# OpenAPI Implementation

OpenAPI offers a framework for building interface files that are machine-readable. These files aid
in describing, generating, consuming, and visualizing REST APIs. You can illustrate your complete
API in JSON or YAML format with OpenAPI. This includes routes, all potential response types and
status codes, and all possible request types. Consequently, a thoroughly composed OpenAPI file can
act as a reference for clients, simplifying API comprehension.

In feTS, this specification is used to generate API documentation and client SDKs. Even on the
server-side, it enables interaction with your API via a playground. Alternatively, you can utilize
any other OpenAPI-compliant tool like Postman for API testing.

By default, feTS creates two endpoints based on the defined routes:

- `/openapi.json` - Outputs the OpenAPI specification in JSON format
- `/docs` - Provides a [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) as an API playground

## Customizing OpenAPI

You have the option to assign a title and a description to your API:

```ts
createRouter({
  openAPI: {
    info: {
      title: 'My API',
      description: 'My API description',
      version: '1.0.0' // You can even assign a version to your API
    }
  }
})
```

## Enhancing Route Information

You can enrich your routes with additional information like `operationId`, `description`, `tags`,
and `deprecated`. This additional data can make your OpenAPI specification more comprehensive.

[Learn more about operations in OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/paths-and-operations/).

```ts
createRouter().route({
  /* OpenAPI specific information */
  operationId: 'getUsers',
  description: 'Get all users',
  tags: ['users'],

  /* Regular configuration */
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/users'
  /* .. */
})
```

## Models / Subschemas

You can create models as subschemas and incorporate them into your routes. This is especially useful
when your API has recurring structures. feTS honors the `$ref` keyword in json schema in this
context.

These models will be presented as models in the OpenAPI specification.

```ts
const router = createRouter({
  components: {
    schemas: {
      // Define a model named User
      User: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          id: { type: 'string' },
          name: { type: 'string' },
          email: { type: 'string' }
        }
      }
    }
  } as const
})
  // Use the User model in different routes
  .route({
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/users',
    schemas: {
      responses: {
        200: {
          type: 'array',
          items: {
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
          }
        }
      }
    } as const,
    handler() {
      return Response.json(users)
    }
  })
  .route({
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/users/:id',
    schemas: {
      responses: {
        200: {
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
        },
        404: {
          type: 'object',
          properties: {
            message: { type: 'string' }
          },
          required: ['message'],
          additionalProperties: false
        }
      }
    } as const,
    handler() {
      const user = users.find(user => user.id === params.id)
      if (!user) {
        return Response.json({ message: 'User not found' }, { status: 404 })
      }
      return Response.json(user)
    }
  })
```

## Disabling OpenAPI

For production, you may not want to expose the schema to the public. In this case, you can pass
`false` to `swaggerUiEndpoint` and `oasEndpoint` options to disable them.

```ts
const router = createRouter({
  swaggerUiEndpoint: false, // or process.env.NODE_ENV ==='production'
  oasEndpoint: false
})
```
