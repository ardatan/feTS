# Working with Cookies in feTS

HTTP cookies are small pieces of data used to maintain stateful information between the client and
the server. They allow the server to recognize a client across multiple requests. To learn more
about the concept of cookies, see the
[HTTP Cookies documentation on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies).

In feTS, a plugin is provided for handling cookies in accordance with the web standard
[CookieStore](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieStore). The plugin allows you
to retrieve cookies from a client's request and send cookies back to the client in your server's
response. Comprehensive details about the CookieStore API are available in
[the MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieStore).

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @whatwg-node/server-plugin-cookies
```

## How to Use Cookies in feTS

First, you need to import the necessary modules and create a router with the `useCookies` plugin:

```ts filename="cookies.ts"
import { createRouter, Response } from 'fets'
import { useCookies } from '@whatwg-node/server-plugin-cookies'

const router = createRouter({
  plugins: [useCookies()]
})
```

Next, you can define routes. In this example, two routes are defined:

1. A `GET` route at `/me` that checks if a `session_id` cookie is present, and if so, retrieves the
   user associated with that session. If the `session_id` cookie is not found, it responds with a
   401 Unauthorized error.

   ```ts filename="cookies.ts"
   .route({
    path: '/me',
    method: 'GET',
    schemas: {/* ... */},
    handler: async request => {
     const sessionId = await request.cookieStore?.get('session_id')
     if (!sessionId) {
       return Response.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
     }
     const user = await getUserBySessionId(sessionId)
     return Response.json(user)
    }
   })
   ```

2. A `POST` route at `/login` that logs a user in by creating a new session for them and setting the
   `session_id` cookie.

   ```ts filename="cookies.ts"
   .route({
     path: '/login',
     method: 'POST',
     handler: async request => {
       const { username, password } = await request.json()
       const sessionId = await createSessionForUser({ username, password })
       await request.cookieStore?.set('session_id', sessionId)
       return Response.json({ message: 'ok' })
     }
    })
   ```

This is a basic usage of the feTS cookies plugin. Depending on your application, you may need to
implement more complex logic for handling cookies.
