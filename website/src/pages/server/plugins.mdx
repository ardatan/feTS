# Plugins

feTS Server provides a plugin system that allows you hook into the request/response lifecycle.

- `onRequest` - Called before the request is handled by the router
- - It has `endResponse` method that accepts a `Response` object to short-circuit the request
- `onResponse` - Called after the request is handled by the router
- - It allows you to modify the response before it is sent to the client

*What is the difference between middlewares and plugins?*

Middlewares can handle the request before the response.

In order to handle specific cases like logging the responses, adding some extra headers to the
response for CORS, cookies etc, we need plugins that catches the final response before it reaches to
the client.

You can also use it for tracing and monitoring.

## Logging the response latency

Let's create a plugin that calculates the response latency and logs it to the console.

```ts
import { RouterPlugin } from 'fets'

export function useLogLatency(): RouterPlugin {
  const startTimeByRequest = new WeakMap<Request, number>()
  return {
    onRequest({ request }) {
      startTimeByRequest.set(request, Date.now())
    },
    onResponse({ request, response }) {
      const startTime = startTimeByRequest.get(request)
      if (startTime) {
        const latency = Date.now() - startTime
        console.log(`Response latency: ${latency}ms`)
      }
    }
  }
}
```
