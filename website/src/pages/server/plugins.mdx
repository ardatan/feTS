# Plugins

The feTS Server includes an extension system, offering the ability to interact with the
request/response process.

- `onRequest` - Invoked prior to the router handling the request.
  - It features an `endResponse` function that takes a `Response` object to preemptively conclude
    the request.
- `onResponse` - Invoked following the router's handling of the request.
  - It offers the ability to alter the response before it's delivered to the client.

<Callout type="info">
**How do middlewares differ from plugins?**

Middlewares are capable of managing the request before the response.

To deal with particular scenarios, such as logging responses, adding additional headers to the
response for CORS or cookies, and so forth, we require plugins that can intercept the final response
before it is received by the client.

It can also be employed for tracing and monitoring purposes.

## Recording the Response Delay

We'll develop an extension that determines the response delay and logs it in the console.

```ts
import { RouterPlugin } from 'fets'

export function useLogDelay(): RouterPlugin {
  const initialTimePerRequest = new WeakMap<Request, number>()
  return {
    onRequest({ request }) {
      initialTimePerRequest.set(request, Date.now())
    },
    onResponse({ request, response }) {
      const initialTime = initialTimePerRequest.get(request)
      if (initialTime) {
        const delay = Date.now() - initialTime
        console.log(`Response delay: ${delay}ms`)
      }
    }
  }
}
```
