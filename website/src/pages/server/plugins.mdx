# Plugins

The feTS Server includes an extension system, offering the ability to interact with the
request/response process.

- `onRequest` - Invoked prior to the router handling the request.
  - It features an `endResponse` function that takes a `Response` object to preemptively conclude
    the request.
- `onResponse` - Invoked following the router's handling of the request.
  - It offers the ability to alter the response before it's delivered to the client.
- `onRouteHandle` - When a route is matched, this is invoked with all the details of the route. So
  you can apply any logic (tracing, auth etc) before the actual handler is invoked.

## Recording the Response Delay

We'll develop an extension that determines the response delay and logs it in the console.

```ts
import { RouterPlugin } from 'fets'

export function useLogDelay(): RouterPlugin {
  const initialTimePerRequest = new WeakMap<Request, number>()
  return {
    onRequest({ request }) {
      initialTimePerRequest.set(request, Date.now())
    },
    onResponse({ request, response }) {
      const initialTime = initialTimePerRequest.get(request)
      if (initialTime) {
        const delay = Date.now() - initialTime
        console.log(`Response delay: ${delay}ms`)
      }
    }
  }
}
```
